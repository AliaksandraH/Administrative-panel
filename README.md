# Administrative panel

An administrative panel is a web interface designed for managing content on websites. It allows administrators to easily make changes without the need to interfere with the website's code. The web interface of the administrative panel is developed with a focus on user-friendliness. Intuitive navigation, clear icons, and sections make the process of website management accessible even to users without technical education.

The use of the administrative panel requires entering a password. This ensures security and prevents unauthorized access.

Using this administrative panel, the administrator has the ability to edit text blocks and replace images. Additionally, through the administrative panel, the administrator can configure meta-tags, such as the page title, description, and keywords. These settings can impact search engine optimization (SEO), the appearance of the page in search results, and on social media.

After completing the editing process, the user can save the changes made, which will result in their immediate display on the website and the creation of data backups.

Inside the administrative panel, there are tools provided for convenient navigation across various pages of the website. This allows for quick switching between sections and effortless editing of the content on each page.

This administrative panel provides convenient and secure management of your website. You can easily modify content, update meta-tags, and create backups to ensure the reliability of your site. This tool helps you effectively manage your web interface.
